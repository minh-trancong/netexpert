    "content": "Liquid C2, a business of Cassava Technologies, a leading pan-African technology group, has introduced Secure360, a comprehensive combination of cyber security services and solutions designed to address the growing complexity of cyber threats across the continent. \n\n Secure360 encompasses four key domains: Governance, Risk, and Compliance; Cyber Threat Assurance; Cyber Defence Services; and Cyber Security Solutions. \n\nUnlike traditional reactive methods, Secure360 employs proactive intelligence-driven threat mitigation strategies that prioritises prevention and preparedness rather than reactive remediation, empowering businesses to stay ahead in an ever-evolving digital environment. Additionally, it offers a holistic, multi-layered defence in-depth approach, enabling customers to achieve end-to-end security, safeguard critical data, mitigate risk, and maintain legislative and regulatory compliance.\n \nAccording to Oswald Jumira, Chief Executive Officer of Liquid C2, “Working with clients across the continent, we’ve seen firsthand how traditional, siloed approaches to security are no longer sufficient. African businesses need holistic, proactive defence strategies that integrate AI, machine learning, and advanced threat protection. Secure360 sees our team of experts and consultants working with our customers to develop bespoke end-to-end solutions and services. The result is a powerful cyber security proposition”.\n\nWorking on the ‘assume compromise’ premise, Secure360 pre-emptively addresses all aspects of security across an organisation’s digital environment. It integrates governance, risk, and compliance, cyber threat assurance, cyber defence, and cyber security solutions to defend against a broad spectrum of cyber threats. This approach ensures that every layer of an organisation’s infrastructure is secure, from networks and applications to data and user access, endpoints, servers, mobile devices, cloud, and supporting infrastructure and operations. From initial testing and assessment to continuous management and monitoring, all aspects of the process are managed.\n\nA recent Gartner survey found that 75% of organisations are consolidating their security vendors to streamline operations and improve risk management. Aligned with this trend, Secure360’s consolidated solutions enable cohesive and integrated security operations, which drive efficiencies, particularly response times, and establish situational awareness through threat intelligence. This consolidation simplifies security management, enhances visibility, and allows for quicker responses to threats."
